# Definition
The exploitation of an XSS vulnerability is the ability for an attacker to inject client-side scripts.

When bug hunting, XSS flaw is often the first look for a researcher but sometimes, this vulnerability is not fully exploited so that its impact is not well explained in the report to the Bug Bounty Program owner (who is not always a security specialist). Too often, this can lead to a small reward and therefore to some frustration on behalf of the researcher.
